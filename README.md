The goal of this project was see if there have been competitions that are statistically harder than others. 

### Implementation Nodes
Code is in `python 3`.
<br>
The explanation and *journey* through the data is avaiable at [rubiks_cubes.ipynb](rubiks_cubes.ipynb).

Additionally a web-tutorial is available at [Rubiks Repo](https://github.com/Camelot314/rubiks)

### Files and Directories
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` - Meta data for jupyter notebook. Not necessary for any understanding
- `count_code.py` - A small python scrpt to count the lines of code in a jupyter file. NOT MINE. It was originally posted at: https://www.javaer101.com/en/article/16819003.html
- `read_tsv.py` - A small python script to read the first 50 lines of a file. It was used to make sure tsv files were formatted correctly
- `rubiks_cubes.ipynb` - The jupyter notebook with all the code used in the analysis.
