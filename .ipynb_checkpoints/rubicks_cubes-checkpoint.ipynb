    "## Background and Definitions\n",
    "The Rubik's Cube was a puzzle game created by ErnÅ‘ Rubik in 1974. Throughout the years it has gained immense popularity as more and more people learn to solve it and compete. \n",
    "I have been solving Rubik's Cubes for over half my life. I am by no means a competition level solver but I have always been interested in the highest levels of speed cubing.\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "Competitions have been going on since the 1980s. For this tutorial we will be finding out if there were specific scrambles (or initial shuffles of the cube) that are harder to solve than others. Futher we can develop a model to determine if a particular scramble is more difficult than others.\n"
